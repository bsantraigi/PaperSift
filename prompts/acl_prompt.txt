Based on the following paper title and abstract, determine if it's primarily related to the chosen (allowed) topics:
- **Allowed Topics**: Information Retrieval systems and techniques, Large Language models (architecture, training, evaluation), Language Generation, 
                    RLHF (Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback), Machine Learning, ML for NLP, Information Theory
- **Blacklisted Topics**: Dialogue Systems, Conversational AI, Machine Translation, Societal/Cultural Impact Papers, Ethical considerations in AI, 
                        Fairness, Accountability, Transparency, and Ethics in AI, Multilingual, Speech, Multi-modality 
- Also avoid papers that are incremental works, i.e., papers that are minor extensions of existing works, or papers that are not novel or significant enough.
- Include papers that might be having some significantly novel contribution on a generic topic like ML, NLP, etc.
- Skip papers that are proceedings of workshops, tutorials, or other non-research papers.

Title: {title}
Abstract: {abstract}

Respond with only "yes", if the paper is primarily about one of allowed topics and not incremental. Say "no", if it is from the blacklisted topics or other 
unspecified topics or fails to satisfy the criteria mentioned above. Be strict in filtering.
Response format: Just 'yes' or 'no'
